                <p class="card-text">Jung Jin is an ordinary 28-year-old woman with a job and a boyfriend, but her boyfriend dumps her and she gets fired from her job. Jung Jin then decides to open a restaurant with her mother. The restaurant goes bankrupt. Her mother goes down to the country and Jung Jin is left alone at the restaurant.
                   At that time, Jo Hee-Ra (Song Ji-Hyo) appears in front of her. Jo Hee-Ra is a witch and she wants to borrow Jung Jin's restaurant to open her own restaurant. Jo Hee-Ra's restaurant would make food that grants a customer's wish. In exchange for granting their wish, the customers would give Jo Hee-Ra something that she wants from them. Jung Jin is skeptical at first, but she has an incredible experience from eating Jo Hee-Ra's food.
